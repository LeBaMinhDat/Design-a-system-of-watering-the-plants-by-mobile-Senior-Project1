# Design-a-system-of-watering-the-plants-by-mobile
## Overview
* With the rapid advancement of contemporary technology, the application of IoT technology in agriculture is now solving many key challenges, particularly water supplies for cultivation. Traditional hand watering adds to the challenge and takes time. As a result, we require effective technology to address these issues. Automated irrigation systems may be used to successfully water plants as needed, allowing you to decide when and how much watering is required. As a result, a smart watering system controlled by the ESP8266 electrical circuit is required, as is monitoring the watering process via a mobile application using IoT technology. 
* This system employs the ESP8266 microcontroller, which is capable of self-control, monitoring, and rapid device processing in an Internet context. In addition to sensor technologies, a microcontroller, relay, DC motor, and battery are used. It functions as a smart switching system, detecting changes in the surrounding environment, soil moisture, and watering the plants as needed. The motor will turn on and off automatically dependent on how dry the earth is. Sensor readings are sent to a computer, which generates graphs that may be analyzed. This sort of irrigation system is simple to use and may be controlled by smart devices. This approach, in general, applies automatically to small and big gardens, greenhouses, and green roofs. This saves both time and energy. From there, optimize water conservation, environmental protection, and crop care for each type of crop.
